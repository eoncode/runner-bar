/// stays in sync whenever either store publishes new data.
/// The entire class is `@MainActor` because all property mutations and reads must happen
/// on the main thread to satisfy SwiftUI's rendering requirements.

    /// Tests **must** set this to avoid leaking into the shared production store.

    ///   context in tests (e.g. `@MainActor func testFoo()` or `await MainActor.run { ... }`).
    /// - Note: `RunnerStore` has no equivalent DI seam — `reload()` always reads `RunnerStore.shared`
    ///   directly. Tests that need to stub GitHub API state must use the real singleton or a
    ///   separate integration-test approach.

    /// Copies the latest state from `RunnerStore` and `LocalRunnerStore` into the published properties.
    ///
    /// Called by Combine sinks in `AppDelegate+PanelSetup` — one on `RunnerStore.didUpdate`
    /// and one on `LocalRunnerStore.$runners`. Also called eagerly in `AppDelegate.openPanel()`
    /// to seed state on first panel open, since the Combine sinks only fire on store changes,
    /// not on initial subscription.
    ///
    /// IMPORTANT: Do NOT call localStore.refresh() here. reload() is a read-only bridge.
    /// Calling refresh() from here creates an infinite loop:
    ///   LocalRunnerStore.$runners publishes
    ///   → reload() is called (via AppDelegate+PanelSetup sink)
    ///   → refresh() runs and completes
    ///   → sets runners, publishes $runners again
    ///   → reload() is called again, forever.
    /// isScanning only prevents concurrent cycles — not sequential ones.
    /// Callers that need a fresh scan (SettingsView, PanelMainView, lifecycle actions)
    /// call LocalRunnerStore.shared.refresh() directly at their own call sites.
    /// Refreshes `localRunners` from `LocalRunnerStore`.
    ///
    /// `runners`, `jobs`, `actions`, `isRateLimited`, and `rateLimitResetDate` are now
    /// **pushed** directly by `RunnerStore.applyFetchResult` via `MainActor.run { }`
    /// after every poll cycle — they must not be pulled here. Pulling stale values
    /// from the actor would require an `await` (breaking the synchronous SwiftUI path)
    /// and would in any case race against the push that already happened.
    ///
    /// Callers that previously relied on `reload()` to seed RunnerStore state on first
    /// panel open no longer need to do so — `RunnerStore` pushes on every completed cycle.
