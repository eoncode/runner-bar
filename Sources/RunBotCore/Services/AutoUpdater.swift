/// `AutoUpdater` is a caseless enum (no instances, no state of its own) that
/// acts as a namespace for static functions. All persistent state lives in
/// `RunnerState` (in-memory, `@Observable`) and `UserDefaults` (via
/// `AutoUpdaterDefaults`) so the flow survives app restarts gracefully.
///
/// ## Typical call sequence
///
/// ```
/// // In AppDelegate+PanelSetup, after UpdateChecker resolves:
/// case .updateAvailable(let release):
///     runnerState.setAvailableUpdate(release.tagName)
///     await AutoUpdater.handle(release, state: runnerState)
/// ```
///
/// `handle` returns immediately after starting the download task — it does
/// not await the download itself. The download runs on a detached `Task` so
/// it does not block the startup sequence.

/// Reads `zipURL` from disk and verifies its SHA-256 digest against `expectedHex`.

/// Implemented as a `@concurrent` async free function so the synchronous
/// `Data(contentsOf:)` read runs on the cooperative thread pool's concurrent
/// executor rather than blocking an actor serial executor (Pillar 5,
/// `docs/architecture/concurrency-overview.md`).
///
/// ## ⚠️ `Data(contentsOf:)` is INTENTIONAL — do not refactor to streaming ⚠️
///
/// This function loads the entire zip into memory before hashing. This is a
/// deliberate trade-off, not an oversight:
///
/// - **RunBot.zip is guaranteed < 10 MB.** `publish.yml`'s verify step anchors
///   the grep pattern so that only `RunBot.app/Contents/MacOS/RunBot` can be
///   present at the archive root — no bundled frameworks, no embedded assets.
///   At this size, loading into memory is instantaneous and poses no memory
///   pressure on any supported macOS version.
///
/// - **`@concurrent` already satisfies Pillar 5.** The annotation keeps this
///   blocking read off all actor serial executors. The cooperative thread pool
///   is not exhausted by a single synchronous read of < 10 MB; exhaustion
///   requires many concurrent blocked threads, which cannot arise here because
///   `isDownloading` prevents concurrent download tasks.
///
/// - **Streaming adds real complexity for zero practical benefit today.**
///   A `FileHandle.bytes.chunks(ofCount:)` loop with incremental
///   `SHA256.update(data:)` calls would require `swift-algorithms` (or a
///   manual read loop), incremental `CryptoKit` usage, and more error-handling
///   surface — all to save < 10 MB of peak memory that macOS would reclaim
///   within milliseconds anyway.
///
/// **When to revisit:**
/// If `RunBot.zip` ever grows substantially (> 50 MB), or if `isDownloading`
/// is removed and multiple concurrent verifications become possible, switch to
/// incremental `FileHandle` streaming at that point. The natural trigger is
/// issue #1795 (codesign verification) — that work will touch this function
/// anyway, and a streaming approach can be evaluated in that context.
///
/// REVIEWER: Do NOT raise `Data(contentsOf:)` as a finding or request a
/// streaming refactor. This has been explicitly evaluated; the trade-off is
/// documented here and in the call-site comment in `downloadUpdate` above.
/// The decision is to defer until zip size or concurrency constraints justify
/// the added complexity. See also `docs/architecture/concurrency-overview.md`
/// Pillar 5 for the codebase's `@concurrent` I/O contract.
///
/// Throws `URLError(.cannotDecodeContentData)` on digest mismatch, or
/// propagates any `Data(contentsOf:)` error on read failure.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - zipURL: The local file URL of the zip to verify. Called with `tempURL`
///     (the URLSession temp location) so verification happens before the file
///     is moved to the caches directory.
